# **Overview**

This project is an initiation to cover some good Data Structures and Algorithms related problems. Being a programmer, practising on as many problems as possible is a must to hone your DSA knowledge. This is a try to create a repo that contains some good (intermediate- advanced level) questions with most efficient approaches. I aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute.

# **Guidelines to be followed:**

Whenever you solve any intermediate -> advance level problem, or a commonly asked one in various coding rounds of hiring process, coding challenges at Codeforces, Codechef, Leetcode, Interviewbit, Hackerrank, Hackerearth or any other platform, you can simultaneously be a part of [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/) community. 

**Make sure** your file name is the question title(not too long) in **CamelCase** with **space between words**.
Each contributed file must contain the **problem statement**, **brief explainantion of approach** and **most efficient (time and space) solution** in said order only.
Check https://github.com/riddhi-jain/DSAmap/blob/main/Arrays/Count%20Iversions.py as sample.
Your solution can be in any programming language ;]
