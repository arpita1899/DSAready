'''Given two sorted arrays, a[] and b[], the task is to find the median of these sorted arrays, in O(log n + log m) time complexity, when n is the number of elements in the first array, and m is the number of elements in the second array.

Approach: The given arrays are sorted, so merge the sorted arrays in an efficient way and keep the count of elements inserted in the output array or printed form. So when the elements in the output array are half the original size of the given array print the element as a median element. There are two cases: 

Case 1: m+n is odd, the median is at (m+n)/2 th index in the array obtained after merging both the arrays.
Case 2: m+n is even, the median will be average of elements at index ((m+n)/2 â€“ 1) and (m+n)/2 in the array obtained after merging both the arrays'''
